The script manages the download folder and makes it tidy by moving all the different files into broadly classified folders.

Currently this is supported for Chrome and Opera browsers.  

Folder names for the different extensions of files are as follows

Images ["jpeg","jpg","png","svg","gif","psd"],
Videos ["mp4","mpeg","mpeg4","3gp","avi","mkv"],
Docs ["xlsx","docx","pptx","txt"],
PDFs ["pdf"],
CompressedFiles ["rar","iso","7z","aar","jar","gz","xz","deb"],
Audio ["mp3","wav"],
Miscellaneous ["opdownload","crdownload"]

Thats all the extensions supported as of now.

Add this script to the startup folder of the OS to start the script on boot. 
Add the path of your download folder in the pathToDownloadFolder.in file
